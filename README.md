# Interactive Visualization for CBECS & RECS

This is a Interactive Data visualization project of Amber Su, Chi Zhang, Curtis Xu for Cornell INFO 3300

The visualization includes selected information from **Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey [CBECS](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/)** and **Residential Energy Consumption Survey [RECS](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/)**.

We aim to build an interactive visualization tool to analyze energy usage patterns of both residential and commericial buildigns across construciton years, building areas, and regions in the United States,providing insights into gas, electricity, heating, and cooling energy consumption. To understand the implecations of building characteristics, such as usage, climate region, construction year, and building area; we create a series of visualizations and interactive filters to help users explore the energy consumption patterns of both residential and commercial buildings.

The visualization is built with d3.js
